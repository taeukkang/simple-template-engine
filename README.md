# simple-template-engine

I needed to write templated content but with different variables for each template. I didn't want to use a full blown templating engine, so I wrote this simple one.

It's simple and works standalone. No need for fancy libraries. Just run `index.html` with a decently modern browser.
Alternatively, you can use the hosted version at [https://projects.taeuk.net/simple-template-engine/](https://projects.taeuk.net/simple-template-engine/).
