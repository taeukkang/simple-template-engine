# simple-template-engine

I needed to write templated content but with different variables. I didn't want to use a full blown templating engine (like mail merge), so I wrote this.

It's simple and works standalone. No need for fancy libraries. Just run `index.html` with a decently modern browser. No hosting required.
Alternatively, an hosted version is available at [https://projects.taeuk.net/simple-template-engine/](https://projects.taeuk.net/simple-template-engine/).
